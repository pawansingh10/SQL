## **SQL Interview Questions**
***

### **SQL Query to find the Nth highest Salary**
- **EMP**
- |Id|Salary|
  |----|------|
  |1  | 10000|
  |2  | 20000|
  |3  | 20000|
  |4  | 30000|
  |5  | 40000|
  |6  | 50000|

- Find Highest Salary from table EMP
  
- ```sql
     SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM EMP;  // 50000
   ```
 
- Find Second Highest Salary from this table EMP
- ```sql
    SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM EMP WHERE Salary NOT IN (SELECT MAX(SALARY) FROM EMP);   // 40000
  ```

- Find the nth Highest salary from the table EMP
- ```sql
     SELECT Id,Salary from EMP e1 WHERE N-1=(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) FROM e2 WHERE e2.Salary > e1.Salary)
  ``` 

> ***Co-related nested Query, recognizes by where the outer query's value used in inner***

-    e1          and           e2

- |Id|Salary|     |        |Id|Salary|
  |----|------|-----|----- |----|------|
  |1  | 10000|      |      |1  | 10000|
  |2  | 20000|      |      |2  | 20000|
  |3  | 20000|      |      |3  | 20000|
  |4  | 30000|      |      |4  | 30000|
  |5  | 40000|      |      |5  | 40000|
  |6  | 50000|      |      |6  | 50000|
 
- Here e2.salary is compare by all e1.salary
- For duplicate value we use DISTINCT otherwise without distinct it works fine!
- For Example we have to find 4th Highest salary then put N=4
- ```sql 
     SELECT Id,Salary from EMP e1 WHERE 4-1=(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) FROM e2 WHERE e2.Salary > e1.Salary)
  ```
- compare 3=count given by sub-query
  
   
  
  






### **SQL Query to delete duplicate rows from a Table**

- |Id |First_Name|Last_name|
  |---|----------|---------|
  |1  |Amit      | Kumar   |
  |2  |Rahul     | Jain    |
  |3  |Akhil     | Karn   |
  |4  |Rahul     | Jain   |
  |5  |Maaz      | Ahmed  |
    
- Check for Duplicate
- ```sql
   SELECT first_name,last_name,count(*) from emp GROUP BY first_name,last_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

- Delete Duplicate by deleting
- ```sql
      DELETE FROM emp e1  
      INNER JOIN  emp e2
      ON e1.first_name=e2.first_name AND e1.last_name=e2.last_name
      WHERE e1.Id < e2.Id;
      
  ```

- Create another table which has no duplicate values
- ```sql
     CREATE TABLE new_emp AS 
     SELECT Id,First_Name,Last_name
     FROM emp
     GROUP BY First_Name,Last_Name;
  ```
  
 - Another way using Row_Number() function
 - ```sql
      WITH newEmp AS
      (
        SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY Id ORDER BY Id) as row_number FROM emp;
      )
      DELETE FROM emp WHERE row_number > 1;
   ```








### **Join in SQL**
***
- ***A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.***
- ***JOIN apply when there is something must be common atleast 1 attribute***
- ***JOIN = CROSS_Product + Condition (select)***

#### Different Types of SQL JOINs
* **INNER JOIN**
  -  Returns records that have matching values in both tables
  -  ```sql
     SELECT column_name
     FROM table1
     INNER JOIN table2
     ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
     ```
  
* **LEFT OUTER JOIN**
  - Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
  
* **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**
  - Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table

* **FULL OUTER JOIN**
  - Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table





### **Constraints in SQL**
Not NULL
Unique
Check
Default
Primary-Key
Foreign-Key

### **Aggregate Functions**
- Aggregate function is a function where the values of multiple rows are grouped together

- **count()**
  - Returns total count of records 
  - Return number of Non Null values

- **sum()**
  - Sum all Non Null values of Column salary

- **avg()**
  - Avg(salary) = Sum(salary) / count(salary) 

- **max()**
  - Maximum value in the salary 

- **min()**
  - Minimum value in the salary column except NULL 

### **SELECT Statement**
___
- The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.

- Syntax 
 ```sql
     SELECT column1, column2, ...
     FROM table_name;
  ```

### **WHERE Clause**
***

- The WHERE clause is used to filter records.

- Syntax
```sql

      FROM table_name 
   WHERE condition;
```
> ***Note : The WHERE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.!***

- SQL statement selects all the customers from the country "Mexico", in the "Customers" table
```sql
   SELECT * FROM Customers
   WHERE Country='Mexico';
```

> ***Operators in The WHERE Clause***

|Operator | Discription|
|---------|------------|
| = | Equal|
| > | Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greater the Equal to|
| <= | Less than Equal to|
| != or <> | Not Equal to |
| BETWEEN | Between Certain Range |

   WHERE NOT Country='Germany' AND NOT Country='USA';
```



### **ORDER BY**
***
- The ORDER BY keyword is used to sort the result-set in ascending or descending order.

> ***The ORDER BY keyword sorts the records in ascending order by default.***

> ***To sort the records in descending order, use the **DESC*****

- Syntax
```sql
   SELECT column1, column2, ...
       FROM table_name
   ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC;

```sql
    UPDATE Customers
       SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
    WHERE CustomerID = 1;
```

### **DELETE Statement**

- The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
- The SELECT TOP clause is useful on large tables with thousands of records
- Returning a large number of records can impact performance.

```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
         FROM table_name
    WHERE condition
    LIMIT number;
```

### **MIN()**
***
- The MIN() function returns the smallest value of the selected column.

       FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
```

- SQL statement finds the average price of all products
```sql
     SELECT AVG(Price)
     FROM Products;
```

### **SUM()**
***
- The SUM() function returns the total sum of a numeric column

        FROM table_name
     WHERE condition;
```
- SQL statement finds the sum of the "Quantity" fields in the "OrderDetails" table
```sql
     SELECT SUM(Quantity)
     FROM OrderDetails;
```

### **LIKE Operator**
***
- The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column

- There are two wildcards often used in conjunction with the LIKE operator
  - ***The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters***
  - ***The underscore sign (_) represents one, single character***

- Syntax
```sql
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
       FROM table_name
    WHERE columnN LIKE pattern;
```

| Like Operator| Discription |
|--------------|-------------|
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a% | Finds any values that start with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' | Finds any values that end with "a" |
| WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' | Finds any values that have "or" in any position|

```sql
     SELECT * FROM Customers
     WHERE CustomerName NOT LIKE 'a%';
```


### **IN Operator**
***
- The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause

> ***The IN operator is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions***

- Syntax
```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
       FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);
```

     WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
```

### **BETWEEN Operator**
***
- The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range.

- The values can be numbers, text, or dates

> ***The BETWEEN operator is inclusive: begin and end values are included***

- Syntax
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name

```

- SQL statement selects all products with a price between 10 and 20. In addition; do not show products with a CategoryID of 1,2, or 3
```sql
      SELECT * FROM Products
      WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20
      AND CategoryID NOT IN (1,2,3);
```

```
```sql
     SELECT * FROM Orders
     WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';
```

### **Aliases**
***
- SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name
- Aliases are often used to make column names more readable
- An alias only exists for the duration of that query
- An alias is created with the AS keyword

- **Alias Column Syntax**
- ```sql
      SELECT column_name AS alias_name
      FROM table_name;
  ```
  
- **Alias Table Syntax**
- ```sql
      SELECT column_name(s)
      FROM table_name AS alias_name;
  ```

- SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerID column and one for the CustomerName column
```sql
    SELECT CustomerID AS ID, CustomerName AS Customer
    FROM Customers;
```

- SQL statement creates two aliases, one for the CustomerName column and one for the ContactName column
```sql
    SELECT CustomerName AS Customer, ContactName AS [Contact Person]
    FROM Customers;
```
> ***Note: It requires double quotation marks or square brackets if the alias name contains spaces***

- SQL statement creates an alias named "Address" that combine four columns (Address, PostalCode, City and Country)
```sql
     SELECT CustomerName, Address + ', ' + PostalCode + ' ' + City + ', ' + Country AS Address
FROM Customers;
```

### **JOIN**
***
- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them

- SQL statement (that contains an INNER JOIN), that selects records that have matching values in both tables
```sql
     SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
          FROM Orders
     INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;
```

### **Different Types of SQL JOINs**
***
- Different types of the JOINs in SQL

| Joins | Discription |
|-------|-------------|
| INNER| Returns records that have matching values in both tables |
| LEFT OUTER | Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table |
| RIGHT OUTER | Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table |
| FULL OUTER | Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table |

### **INNER JOIN**
***
- The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables

- Syntax
```sql
      SELECT column_name(s)
          FROM table1
      INNER JOIN table2
      ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- SQL statement selects all orders with customer information
```sql
      SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName
          FROM Orders
      INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
```

- SQL statement selects all orders with customer and shipper information
```sql
    SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Shippers.ShipperName
       FROM ((Orders
    INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
    INNER JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
```

### **LEFT OUTER JOIN**
***
- Syntax
```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
      FROM table1
    LEFT JOIN table2
    ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- SQL statement will select all customers, and any orders they might have
```sql
    SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID
        FROM Customers
    LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
    ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

### **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**
***
- Syntax
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s)
          FROM table1
     RIGHT JOIN table2
     ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```

- SQL statement will return all employees, and any orders they might have placed
```sql
   SELECT Orders.OrderID, Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName
      FROM Orders
   RIGHT JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
   ORDER BY Orders.OrderID;
```

### **FULL OUTER JOIN**
***
- Syntax
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s)
         FROM table1
     FULL OUTER JOIN table2
     ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name
     WHERE condition;
```

- SQL statement selects all customers, and all orders
```sql
     SELECT Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderID 
         FROM Customers
     FULL OUTER JOIN Orders ON Customers.CustomerID=Orders.CustomerID
     ORDER BY Customers.CustomerName;
```

### **Self Join**
***
- ***A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself.***

- Syntax
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s)
         FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
     WHERE condition;
```

> T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table.

- SQL statement matches customers that are from the same city:
```sql
      SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
            FROM Customers A, Customers B
      WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
      AND A.City = B.City
      ORDER BY A.City;
```

### **UNION Operator**
***
- The UNION operator is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements.
  - Every SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns
  - The columns must also have similar data types
  - The columns in every SELECT statement must also be in the same order
  
- Syntax
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1
         UNION
     SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
```

- SQL statement returns the cities (only distinct values) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table
```sql
    SELECT City FROM Customers
         UNION
    SELECT City FROM Suppliers
    ORDER BY City;
```

- SQL statement returns the cities (duplicate values also) from both the "Customers" and the "Suppliers" table:
```sql
     SELECT City FROM Customers
         UNION ALL
     SELECT City FROM Suppliers
     ORDER BY City;
```


### **GROUP BY**
***
- The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country"

- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns

- Syntax 
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s)
        FROM table_name
     WHERE condition
     GROUP BY column_name(s)
     ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

- SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country
```sql
    SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country 
        FROM Customers
    GROUP BY Country;
```

- SQL statement lists the number of orders sent by each shipper
```sql
     SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
     LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
     GROUP BY ShipperName;
```

### **Having**
- The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.
- Syntax
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s)
       FROM table_name
     WHERE condition
     GROUP BY column_name(s)
     HAVING condition
     ORDER BY column_name(s);     
 ```
  
- SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country. Only include countries with more than 5 customers:
```sql
     SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
       FROM Customers
     GROUP BY Country
     HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5;     
```
 
- SQL statement lists the number of customers in each country, sorted high to low (Only include countries with more than 5 customers)
```sql
     SELECT COUNT(CustomerID), Country
         FROM Customers
     GROUP BY Country
     HAVING COUNT(CustomerID) > 5
     ORDER BY COUNT(CustomerID) DESC;
```
- SQL statement lists the employees that have registered more than 10 orders
```sql
      SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
            FROM (Orders
      INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
      GROUP BY LastName
      HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;
```
- SQL statement lists if the employees "Davolio" or "Fuller" have registered more than 25 orders
```sql
     SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders
            FROM Orders
     INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
     WHERE LastName = 'Davolio' OR LastName = 'Fuller'
     GROUP BY LastName
     HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
```

### **EXISTS Operator**
***
- The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery

- The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.

- Syntax
```sql
     SELECT column_name(s)
         FROM table_name
     WHERE EXISTS
     (SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);
```

- SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price less than 20
```sql
     SELECT SupplierName
         FROM Suppliers
     WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price < 20);
```
- SQL statement returns TRUE and lists the suppliers with a product price equal to 22
```sql
    SELECT SupplierName
       FROM Suppliers
    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE Products.SupplierID = Suppliers.supplierID AND Price = 22);

```

### **ANY and ALL Operators**
***
- The ANY and ALL operators allow you to perform a comparison between a single column value and a range of other values.

| Any Operator | returns a boolean value as a result |
|--------------|------------------------------------|
| Any Operator | returns TRUE if ANY of the subquery values meet the condition |

> ***ANY means that the condition will be true if the operation is true for any of the values in the range.***

- ANY Syntax
```sql
    SELECT column_name(s)
          FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name operator ANY
    (SELECT column_name
          FROM table_name
    WHERE condition);
```

| All Operator |returns a boolean value as a result|
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| All Operator |returns TRUE if ALL of the subquery values meet the condition|
| All Operator | used with SELECT, WHERE and HAVING statements |

> ***ALL means that the condition will be true only if the operation is true for all values in the range***

- ALL Syntax With SELECT
```sql
      SELECT ALL column_name(s)
          FROM table_name
      WHERE condition;
```
- ALL Syntax With WHERE or HAVING
```sql
      SELECT column_name(s)
          FROM table_name
      WHERE column_name operator ALL
      (SELECT column_name
      FROM table_name
      WHERE condition);
```

- SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity equal to 10
```sql
     SELECT ProductName
          FROM Products
     WHERE ProductID = ANY
     (SELECT ProductID
          FROM OrderDetails
     WHERE Quantity = 10);
```

- SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 99 
```sql
      SELECT ProductName
           FROM Products
      WHERE ProductID = ANY
      (SELECT ProductID
           FROM OrderDetails
      WHERE Quantity > 99);
```

- SQL statement lists the ProductName if it finds ANY records in the OrderDetails table has Quantity larger than 1000
```sql
     SELECT ProductName
          FROM Products
     WHERE ProductID = ANY
     (SELECT ProductID
         FROM OrderDetails
     WHERE Quantity > 1000);
```

- SQL statement lists ALL the product names
```sql
     SELECT ALL ProductName
           FROM Products
     WHERE TRUE;
```
